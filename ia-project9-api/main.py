"""
Created by Jean-François Subrini on the 8th of April 2023.
Creation of a simple sentiment analysis REST API using the FastAPI framework 
and a Model-Based Collaborative Filtering approach, with the SVD algorithm, 
created in the Subrini_JeanFrancois_2_scripts_012023.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
This REST API has been deployed on Heroku (https://ia-api-project9.herokuapp.com).
